You've played snake before. You've played roguelikes. Now, we mix them together using thousands of years of human progression to make a sure highlight game for years (or maybe a few days... if that): Gunsnake.

**About**

Enter a dark, mysterious temple as humanity's finest piece of engineering -- the Gunsnake. Traverse 3 procedurally generated areas and use 18 items in different combinations. Master the unconventional movement and aiming systems as you try and conquer the Temple.
